-----------------------------------------------

@author Samata Bulusu

1. The neighborhood map outlines Chicago's Magnificent Mile in blue. Visit
   my github page http://samatabulusu.github.io/Neighborhood-Map/ to explore
   online, the heart of The Windy City!
2. Alternately, to begin, open index.html file in your internet browser.
3. A number of points of interest along the Magnificent Mile are shown by
   google markers. Clicking on the marker will show information about the location
   from Yelp, our third party API.
4. Points of interest are also conveniently displayed to the right of the browser.
5. Clicking on any of them, will drop a marker to that location, with an information
   window opened, displaying data from Yelp reviews.
6. Points of interest can also be searched using the search bar. As you type, the
   markers will appear or disappear as the searched string matches with the names
   of points of interest.
7. The current weather conditions in Chicago are displayed above the map to help
   you plan for the trip to Michigan Avenue. The weather data has been retrieved
   using another AJAX call to Weather Underground API service.
8. Hope this neighborhood map of the best of downtown Chicago, will make you want
   to visit The Windy City. Please check the forecast before you come. The temperatures
   can range from -25F to 100F in our city :) depending on the time of the year.
